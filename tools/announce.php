Im writing today to let you know that Gnafi, the hobby project Ive put much effort into, is moving to another owner. I believe this is good news since I simply dont have any time to continue with this (and about another dozen past free-lance hobbies). I hope the new owner will commit to it and make sure the ongoing development continues.

During the past few years much has changed for me; I moved to China, started an IT company, and then launched several independent ventures. As such, everything that was in my life a few years ago is already forgotten or on its way there - and Im not the kind of person who lives the past. Finally, I cant wait for this feature/site, whatever you want call it, to turn into something very useful  even for a guy like me who now (fortunately or otherwise) doesnt use internet for much more than emails & skype (well.., also blogging).
